GeoExplore
==========

Overview
--------

GeoExplore is a GIS Library which provides useful utilities for conducting research
and analysis of geo-spatial information. In addition, we are currently working on a
3D mapping server which will allow clients to view image data in 3D provided appropriate 
elevation data exists.
