Comments on this current structure

1. Image and DiskImage both use the same base class.  The difference is the ResourceType.  This keeps a good uniform structure. 


2.  DiskResource vs MemoryResource
    - Necessary operations for both
        - operator()( x, y) (getter)

    - DiskResource Only
        - setImageDriver/getImageDriver

    - MemoryResource Only
        - operator()( x, y) (setter)

    *  Considerations:
        -> Will the setter on the DiskResource do anything? Here are the options...
            a) Do nothing, don't set anything.
            b) Throw exception.
            c) Throw compiler error (How?)
